<h1><strong>	SMART MEDICAL DISPENSER</strong></h1><br>
		our idea is to setup a smart medical dispenser in which doctor examines the patient through video conferencing.
		Further the prescribed medicines from the doctor will be automatically dispensed in the dispenser.<br>


	<h1>	<strong>IDEA</strong></h1>
		We deploy the Anytime Medical Counter in all the rural areas where people cannot get the doctor on track.
		 We install Heart Beat,Temperature sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, pressure sensor, weighing machine, Camera and Head phones to the medical dispenser.
 An Application is installed in both the ends for audio and visual communication & chatting with doctor.Smart medical dispenser is attached which delivers the medicines prescribed by the doctor.
<br>

<h1><strong>		PROBLEMS</strong></h1>
				to improve medical adherence, various methods are being carried out. But the problem with the existing system is, it has only dispensers that dispense medicines according to schedule. Also the people in rural areas may not be aware of those applications for medical support.
<br>

	<h1><strong>	UNIQUE SELLING POINT</strong></h1>
